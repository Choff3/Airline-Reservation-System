This application was the final project for my CIS3270 - Application Development class.

The database for the app was originally hosted by Georgia State University but my 
access was revoked after the course was finished.

I have set up an AWS account to host the database so that the app can continue to function.

If the app has issues connecting, that is most likely because of the AWS free tier bandwidth limit for the month being reached.
